History Quiz

Had a bit more trouble with this one than I initially anticipated. With that said, I plan on putting some more work into this over the next few days to get it working the way I want to.

I used basic HTML element, CSS, bootstrap, JS, and jQuery to construct it.

I wanted to balance something visually appealing with a well functioning, short quiz. I think I may have dug myself into a bit of a hole, though. I'm having a particularly difficult time taking the values I've pulled from my answer and comparing them to my correct answers. I've pseudocoded essentially everything that I had planned. I'm just not entirely sure how I'd achieve it. I think I'm fairly close, but missing a few essential components to get it to run the way I'd like.
